# IP Intelligence is a free tool that attempts to determine how likely an IP address is a proxy / VPN / bad IP using mathematical and modern computing techniques

* Protect your site from automated XSS / SQL Injection / Brute Force / Crawlers that steal your content
* Serve traffic / content to real users, not bots, which reduces server load
* Stop bots from scraping your content or bots spamming your website
* Prevent trolls / people that are trying to bypass a ban
* Greatly reduce fraud on e-commerce sites (anti-fraud)
* Since the system returns a _real value_, you can customize the level of protection for a particular time frame and adjust accordingly.
* Use it with a combination of another fraud prevention service to make it even better. Some fraud prevention services do not explicitly look for proxy / VPN IPs. 

The system is serving millions of API requests a week and growing as more people find it useful in protecting their online infrastructure.
